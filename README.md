WebPd JS/Wasm audio compiler
=============================

A compiler that takes a DSP graph as an input and renders source code as an output. For now, supported targets are :

- **JavaScript** : faster compilation
- **AssemblyScript** : can be compiled to WebAssembly for better performance

This is part of the [WebPd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd) project, but can also be used as a standalone library (although for now you'll have to read the source).
