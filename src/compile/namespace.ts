 * Helper to declare namespace objects enforcing stricter access rules. Specifically, it forbids :
 * - reading an unknown property.
 * - trying to overwrite an existing property.
 *
 * Also allows to access properties starting with a number by prepending a `$`.
 * This is convenient to access portlets by their id without using indexing syntax, for example :
 * `namespace.$0` instead of `namespace['0']`.
